## What is Fliphone?

Fliphone connects your Discord server's designated channel with a random stranger's server for a real-time, anonymous conversation — like a phone call between two servers. It also supports **group rooms** with up to 6 servers chatting at once.

Messages are relayed in real time. Fliphone **never stores message content.**

---

## Features

- **1-on-1 calls** — matched instantly when someone is waiting, or queued for up to 10 minutes
- **Group rooms** — up to 6 servers in one room, identified by NATO station names
- **Webhook relay** — messages appear with the sender's real name and avatar (when bot has Manage Webhooks)
- **Anonymous mode** — senders appear as *Stranger [NATO word]* with a robot avatar
- **GIF moderation** — built-in report system with blacklist/whitelist management
- **Content filter** — automatic censorship of slurs and harmful language
- **Block list** — prevent specific servers from ever matching with yours again
- **Queue notifications** — opt-in DMs when someone is waiting with no match
- **Vote reminders** — opt-in top.gg vote prompts (max once per 12 hours)
- **Rate limiting** — lax flood protection with progressive warnings
- **Inactivity auto-hangup** — calls end automatically after 10 minutes of silence

## Quick Start

### 1. Invite the bot

[**➕ Add Fliphone to your server**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1489342959974486158&permissions=536988736&scope=bot+applications.commands)

**Required permissions:**
| Permission | Used for |
|---|---|
| View Channel | Reading messages in the phonebooth channel |
| Send Messages | Sending relay messages and status embeds |
| Manage Webhooks | ⭐ Seamless relay with real avatars/names |
| Embed Links | All status and help embeds |
| Attach Files | Relaying file attachments |
| Read Message History | Webhook lookup and reply context |
| Add Reactions | Future feature support |

### 2. Set up your channel

In the channel you want to use as the phonebooth, run:

```
f.setup
```

The bot creates a webhook automatically (if it has Manage Webhooks permission) and registers that channel. You only need to do this once.

### 3. Start a call

```
f.call
```

If another server is waiting, you connect instantly. Otherwise you join the queue (auto-cancels after 10 minutes).

## How Calls Work

```
Server A  ──f.call──►  Queue  ◄──f.call──  Server B
                         │
                    [matched!]
                         │
Server A  ◄──relay──   Bot  ──relay──►  Server B
```

1. Admin runs `f.setup` in the chosen channel — registers it and creates a webhook.
2. A user runs `f.call` — bot looks for a match from a *different* server (respecting block lists).
   - **Match found** → both channels get a *Connected!* message and relay begins.
   - **No match** → channel enters the queue (10-minute timeout, then auto-cancels).
3. Every non-command message sent in a connected channel is relayed to the partner.
4. Either side runs `f.hangup` → call ends, stats logged, both channels notified.

### Relay priority

1. **Webhook relay** (if bot has Manage Webhooks) — message appears with the sender's real name and avatar, no bot prefix clutter.
2. **Fallback plain message** — if webhooks aren't available, the bot sends `**Name**\nmessage`.

### What gets relayed

- ✅ Text messages (censored through the content filter)
- ✅ GIFs from Tenor, Giphy, and Klipy (with per-server mode controls)
- ✅ Replies with context (shows who you're replying to)
- ✅ Sticker names (stickers themselves can't cross servers, but the name is mentioned)
- ❌ External links (stripped — only GIF links are allowed)
- ❌ Images and video attachments (blocked for safety)
- ❌ Custom emoji (they won't render in other servers)

## How Group Rooms Work

Group rooms work like a conference call for up to 6 servers. Each server is assigned a **NATO station name** (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot) — your real server name is never revealed.

- Run `f.room` to join. If an active room has space and you haven't been in it, you slot straight in.
- If no room is available, a new room is created and waits for others.
- A room becomes **active** once 2+ servers have joined.
- New servers can join active rooms up to the maximum size of 6.
- If fewer than 2 servers remain after someone leaves, the room closes automatically.

**Vote kick:** Any server can run `f.roomkick <Station>` to start a majority vote to remove a misbehaving station (requires 3+ servers in the room). The vote lasts 60 seconds.

---

## GIF Mode

Server admins can control how GIFs are handled in their server's calls:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | All GIFs from Tenor, Giphy, Klipy, and `.gif` links are relayed (default) |
| `limited` | Only Tenor, Giphy, and Klipy links are relayed — direct `.gif` URLs blocked |
| `disabled` | All GIFs are blocked — none sent or received |

Set with: `f.gifmode enabled` / `f.gifmode limited` / `f.gifmode disabled`

When one side has restrictions, both sides are notified at the start of the call.
